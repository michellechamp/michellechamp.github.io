            <p>As a 5-foot-3-inch woman, dressing for my body type isn't always easy when most pants, long-sleeve shirts and jackets ooze a trail of extra fabric.</p>
            <p> Over the past years, I've learned what works best for my body and what definitely doesn't. I'll share my tips on how to dress as a petite woman.</p> 
            <p>Ideally, when you're height-deficient, like me, you have 3 goals when getting dressed.</p>
                <h3>

                <li>Appear longer (and taller)</li>
                <li>Have a flattering silhouette</li>
                <li>Avoid boxyness </li>

        <h4>How to Appear Longer</h4>
        
        <p>The best thing you can do as a small person is avoid bulky pieces. Oversized clothing will swallow your figure and give you the illusion of having a heavier body than you do. The key is wearing tailored pieces that create a slim, form-fitting line.</p>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>1. Dress in solid colors on bottom.</strong> Pairing black pants with black boots will make your legs look like they go on for miles. If you're wearing a dress or a skirt, wear nude pumps that match your skin tone. They help the flow of line, rather than having a pair of colored shoes that break that line.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Pay attention to necklines. </strong> A V-neck or a scoop-neck shirt will be more flattering than a crewneck. It will help elongate your neck and chest.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Try high-waisted pieces.</strong> High-waisted pants or skirts can help elongate your legs by alluding the eye. </p>
            </ul>
    
        <h4>How to Get a Flattering Silhouette</h4>


    <p>As a petite woman, it's important to focus on fit when purchasing clothes. It's okay if something is a little big, as long as you have it tailored. Clothes that fit your body perfectly always look professional and chic. Don't hide your awesome figure underneath fabric that isn't flattering you. Clothes are designed to make you feel great, afterall.</p>

            <ul>
                <p><strong>1. Use a belt. </strong> Cinching your waist will help define your figure and add an hourglass shape to any dress.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Wear monotone colors. </strong> Matching a black belt with black pants will help keep your look streamlined and long. Having a red belt will break up your line. </p>
                <p><strong>3. Avoid flowy clothes.</strong> Loose clothing hides your body and can seem overwhelming for small women. Structured pieces will define your silhouette and shape your figure. Try tucking in your shirt to have a cleaner look.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Length.</strong> You may tempted to play around with higher hems if you're short. Don't. You should always dress age-appropriate. A shorter hem doesn't always promise longer legs. You'd be surprised how much a knee-length skirt can be flattering for you.</p>
            </ul>
    
                <h4>Avoiding Boxyness</h4>
    
            <ul>
                <p><strong>1. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>2. Use small accessories.</strong> Avoid wearing swallowing scarves, big, chunky jewelry or thick belts. Your best bet is sticking to smaller accessories that don't overwhelm your frame.</p>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>Stars like Mila Kunis, Madonna, Reese Witherspoon, Rachel Bilson and Salma Haykey all have petite figures. </p>
            <p>Celebrities are a great source of fashion inspiration. They can help show you what trends look good on your figure, and how to wear them.</p>
            <p>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, both only 5-foot-2-inch, have cultivated their own sense of style that works best for their body. They'll wear loose pieces of clothing, but structure them with a sharp blazer or tie on a belt.</p>
        
            
        <h2>Interview with a Stylist</h2>    
        <p>I interviewed with Sofia Dolan, a stylist at <b><a href="http://www.thewebstermiami.com" target="_blank">The Webster</a></b>, a high-end popular boutique in Miami Beach, that caters to fashionable stars. She has helped style petite stars like Kourtney and Kim Kardashian to ANOTHER STAR. Sofia, also a 5-foot-3-inch woman, has learned over the past years what clothing works for her, and her clients.</p>
