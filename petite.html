            <p>As a 5-foot-3-inch woman, dressing for my body type isn't always easy when most pants, long-sleeve shirts and jackets ooze a trail of extra fabric.</p>
            <p> Over the past years, I've learned what works best for my body and what definitely doesn't. I'll share my tips on how to dress as a petite woman.</p> 
            <p>Ideally, when you're height-deficient, like me, you have 3 goals when getting dressed.</p>
                <h3>
                <ol>
                <li>Appear longer (and taller)</li>
                <li>Have a flattering silhouette</li>
                <li>Avoid boxyness </li>
                </ol>
                </h3>    

        <h4>How to Appear Longer</h4>
        
        <p>The best thing you can do as a small person is to avoid bulky pieces. Oversized clothing will swallow your figure and give you the illusion of having a heavier body than you actually do. The key is wearing tailored pieces that create a slim, form-fitting line.</p>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>1. Dress in solid colors on bottom.</strong> Pairing black pants with black boots will make your legs look like they go on for miles. If you're wearing a dress or a skirt, wear nude pumps that match your skin tone. They help the flow of line, rather than having a pair of colored shoes that break that line.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Pay attention to necklines. </strong> A V-neck or a scoop-neck shirt will be more flattering than a crewneck shirt. It will help elongate your neck.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Try high-waisted pieces.</strong> High-waisted pants or skirts can help elongate your legs by alluding the eye of a higher waist (hence the name). </p>
            </ul>
    
        <h4>How to Get a Flattering Silhouette</h4>

            </div>  
            
    <p>As a petite woman, it's important to focus on fit when purchasing clothes. Clothes that fit your body perfectly (not too big or not too snug) always look professional and chic. Don't hide your awesome figure underneath pieces that aren't flattering. Clothes are designed to make you feel great, afterall.</p>

            <ul>
                <p><strong>1. Wear monotone colors. </strong> Matching a black belt with black pants will help keep your look streamlined and long. Having a red belt, for example, will break up that line. </p>
                <p><strong>2. Heels. </strong> They may hurt your feet, but they will help your look. Try a nude pair that matches your skin tone or matching black pumps with opaque black tights. Even if your heels are not sky-high, they will make your legs look long.
                <p><strong>3. Length.</strong> You may tempted to play around with higher hems if you're short. Don't. You should always dress age-appropriate. A shorter hem doesn't always promise longer legs. You'd be surprised how much a knee-length skirt can be flattering for you. Think Victoria Beckham (she's short, too!).</p>
                </ul>  
    
              <h4>Avoiding Boxyness</h4>
    
            <ul>
                <p><strong>1. Use a belt. </strong> Cinching your waist will help define your figure and add an hourglass shape to any look.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Use small accessories.</strong> Avoid wearing swallowing scarves, big, chunky jewelry or thick belts. They will overwhelm your petite frame.</p>
               <p><strong>3. Avoid flowy clothes.</strong> Loose clothing hides your body and can seem overwhelming for small women. Try tucking in your shirt to have a cleaner look. Or pair a flowy top with a skinny jeans to offset the balance.</p>
            </ul>

            <p>Stars like Mila Kunis, Madonna, Reese Witherspoon, Rachel Bilson and Salma Haykey all have petite figures. </p>
            <p>Celebrities are a great source of fashion inspiration. They can help show you what trends look good on your figure, and how to wear them.</p>
            <p>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, both only 5-foot-2-inch, have cultivated their own sense of style that works best for their body. They'll wear loose pieces of clothing, but structure them with a sharp blazer or tie on a belt.</p>
        
            
        <h2>Interview with a Stylist</h2>    
        <p>I interviewed with Sofia Dolan, a stylist at <b><a href="http://www.thewebstermiami.com" target="_blank">The Webster</a></b>, a high-end popular boutique in Miami Beach, that caters to fashionable stars. She has helped style petite stars like Kourtney and Kim Kardashian find clothing that suits their small bodies. Sofia, a 5-foot-4-inch woman, has learned over the past years what clothing works for her, and her clients.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: What are some of your personal tips for dressing as a petite woman?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Sofia:</strong> Pick pieces that flatter your waist. Also, don't wear anything that isn't tailored to fit you perfectly. Even taking something in an extra inch can make the biggest difference to your figure. </p>

    <p><strong>Q: What do petite women look best in?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Sofia:</strong> Either long dresses (not too flowy) or short, flirty pieces. I love pairing tight jeans with a flowy top, and adding a structered jacket, like a motorcycle jacket, on top to add a cool factor. Just don't wear pieces that have too much extra fabric. You'll look like your swimming in your dress rather than wearing it.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Best piece of advice for getting dressed?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Sofia:</strong> Always look like you are wearing the piece, not that the piece is wearing you. Just wear what you love but make it work for your body.</p>
