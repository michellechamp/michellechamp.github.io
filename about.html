            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> I was originally born from Argentina, raised in California and brought over to Florida about six years ago, where I ended up at the University of Florida in Spring 2012. </p>
            <p> I knew I wanted to enter journalism when I realized, as a little girl, that instead of just pouring over all my mom's vintage Vogue's and Bazaar's, I could create magazines. Art has always been a part of me, while writing was a challenge I enjoyed doing. </p>
            <p> I hope one day I can merge my two life-long loves of art and writing through design and editing.</p>
            <p> Although most people have an oblique outlook on journalism's industry, I am excited to see where all the exciting innovations take us.</p>
