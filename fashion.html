            <p>I started my fashion blog in the fall of 2012. It began as a class assignment and eventually grew into a hobby I enjoyed doing. </p>
            <p>Fashion has always been an interest of mine and I wanted to share not only my outfits, but the looks of others. Along with that, I offer my opinion and tips on college, beauty, baking, and more.</p>
            <p>Here's some of my favorite pieces I have published in the past.</p>

        <a href="http://uffashionfiles.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/cold-winter-days/" target="_blank"> <img src="img/vest.jpg" width="50" title"Herringbone vest" alt="vest" href="http://uffashionfiles.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/cold-winter-days/"/></a>
        <p>I loved doing this outfit post. I had been seeing this J Crew herringbone vest on several blogs I follow and thought it would be cool to show my readers how I would style it. I received a lot of attention and got to communicate with my readers on their looks!</p>

        <p>I recently tried out Adobe CS6's 30-day trial and gave the new Illustrator a whirl. I am <i>in love</i>. I made this picture in Illustratory (borrowed the image) and had fun creating a more visual piece.</p>    
        <a href="http://uffashionfiles.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/happy/" target="_blank"> <img src="img/happy.jpg" width="50" title"happy girls are the prettiest" alt="audrey hepburn" href="http://uffashionfiles.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/happy/"/></a>    
            
        <p>I went on to create more pieces with Illustrator by taking my favorite quotes and patterns I gathered around online and put them together. It was fun creating pieces I could then share on Instagram to more followers.</p>    
        <a href="http://uffashionfiles.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/jeweled-sweaters/" target="_blank"> <img src="img/sweater.jpg" width="50" title"jeweled sweatshirts" alt="sweatshirts" href="http://uffashionfiles.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/jeweled-sweaters/"/></a> 
            
        <p>This post was great because it spurred reader inspiration. A follower of mine saw this post and wanted to give it a DIY try. She created a piece of her own by putting studs in on an old sweater. I love this kind of interaction with readers and that's one reason that keeps me blogging.</p>
